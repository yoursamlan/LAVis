## Introduction
The Lorenz equations were originally derived
by Saltzman (1962) as a ‘minimalist’ model
of thermal convection in a box
```
x˙ = σ(y − x)           .......(1)
y˙ = ρx − y − xz        .......(2)
z˙ = xy − βz            .......(3)
```
where σ (“Prandtl number”), ρ (“Rayleigh
number”) and β are parameters (> 0). These
equations also arise in studies of convection
and instability in planetary atmospheres, models of lasers and dynamos etc.
